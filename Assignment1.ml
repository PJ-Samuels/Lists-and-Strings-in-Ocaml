I pledge that this program represents my own
program code and that I have coded on my own. I received
help from no one in designing and debugging my program.
I have read the course syllabus of CS 320 and have read the sections on Collaboration
and Academic Misconduct. I also understand that I may be asked to meet the instructor
or the TF for a follow up interview on Zoom. I may be asked to explain my solution in person and
may also ask you to solve a related problem.

TODO:
The function list_of_list_of_int_as_string takes in as input a list of list of 
int and evaluates into its string representation. 

Here are some test cases on how list_of_list_of_int_as_string must work: 
list_of_list_of_int_as_string [[1];[2]] will evaluate into "[[1];[2]]"
list_of_list_of_int_as_string [[1;2;3]] will evaluate into "[[1;2;3]]"
list_of_list_of_int_as_string [[1];[2];[3];[4]] will evaluate into "[[1];[2];[3];[4]]"
list_of_list_of_int_as_string [[1]] will evaluate into "[[1]]"
list_of_list_of_int_as_string [] will evaluate into "[]"

TODO:
Write a function called `repeat` that given a number and a length:
returns a list containing that number, n times.
If the length is zero or negative it should return an empty list.
The solution should be tail recursive
For example,
  repeat 4 7 = [4; 4; 4; 4; 4; 4; 4]
  repeat 3 3 = [3; 3; 3]
  repeat 10 0 = []
  repeat 4 1000000 does not stack overflow

TODO:
Hint: use the following helper function 
let rec insert (i: int) (list: int list): int list = fail with "unimplemented"

that takes a a number, an already sorted ls and returns a new sorted list with that number unsorted
for example,

insert 5 [1;3;5;7] = [1;3;5;5;7]
